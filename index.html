          My name is Oshin, and I am a fourth year undergraduate studnt
          majoring in computer science. This is my final quarter at UCSB, and I
          hope to make the most of it despite the current circumstances.

          I decided to take Human-Computer Interaction as I have an interest in
          product design and working on aspects of a product that the consumer
          actively interacts with. I have experimented with web and mobile app
          design in the past, and I hope this course will help fill gaps in my
          technical knowledge and provide me more context in terms of design
          principles, further technologies, and how to guage how a user will
          view and utilize a product.
